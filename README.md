# Has the frequency of English first person singular pronouns (FPSP) (I, my, mine, me) changed on Twitter as time passes?

### Topic: 

Variation of first person pronoun usage overtime.

On the surface, it is easy to say that self-centred behaviours
have become much more common in recent years (selfies, TikTok, etc.),
but is there any real truth in that?

### Significance: 

This research could shed light on changes in self-absorbed behaviours,
and the most basic way to measure this would be through the usage of
first person pronouns (particularly the singulars: I, my, mine, me).

Previous research seems to have already shown that self-praising behaviours such as humblebrags have become more mainstream.
Could the frequency of FPSP shed more light on that?

### Variables:

1. N-gram of FPSP in English Twitter data (dependent)
2. Year of the Tweets' writing (independent)
3. N-gram of overall pronouns as a baseline (dependent)

### Hypotheses:

We'll get back to you on that.

### Dataset:

Dataset is obtained from the RUG Dutch Tweet database. All Tweets are taken from January 15th 2013-2023. In particular, the tenth file for each day is chosen to maintain consistency.
